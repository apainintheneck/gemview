The standard gem brings the ethos of StandardJS » https://standardjs.com to
Ruby. It’s a linter & formatter built on
RuboCop » https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop and provides an unconfigurable
configuration to all of RuboCop’s built-in rules as well as those included in
rubocop-performance » https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-performance. It also
supports plugins built with
lint_roller » https://github.com/standardrb/lint_roller, like
standard-rails » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-rails and
standard-sorbet » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-sorbet.

Standard Ruby was created and is maintained by the team at Test
Double » https://testdouble.com, because we appreciate the importance of
balancing predictable, consistent code with preserving developer autonomy. 💚

  Wait, did you say unconfigurable configuration?

  Yes, Standard is unconfigurable. See, pretty much every developer can agree 
  that
  automatically identifying and fixing slow, insecure, and error-prone code is a
  good idea. People also agree it’s easier to work in codebases that exhibit a
  consistent style and format. So, what’s the problem? No two developers will
  ever agree on what all the rules and format should be.

  This has resulted in innumerable teams arguing about how to configure their 
  linters
  and formatters over literal decades. Some teams routinely divert time and 
  energy
  from whatever they’re building to reach consensus on where commas should go.
  Other teams have an overzealous tech lead who sets up everything his favorite
  way and then imposes his will on others. It’s not uncommon to witness
  passive-aggressive programmers change a contentious rule back-and-forth,
  resulting in both acrimony and git churn (and acrimony about git churn).
  Still, most developers give way to whoever cares more, often resulting in an
  inconsistent configuration that nobody understands and isn’t kept up-to-date
  with changes to their linter and its target language. Whatever the approach,
  time spent
  bikeshedding » https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2019-09-17-bike-shed-history/
  is time wasted.

  But you can’t configure Standard Ruby. You can take it or leave it. If this
  seems presumptive, constraining, and brusque: you’re right, it usually does feel
  that way at first. But since
  2018 » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLyV5hOqGQ8, the Ruby community has
  debated Standard Ruby’s ruleset, ultimately landing us on a
  sensible » /config/base.yml
  set » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-performance/blob/main/config/base.yml
  of
  defaults » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-custom/blob/main/config/base.yml
  that—while no one person’s favorite way to format Ruby—seems to be good enough
  for most of the ways people use Ruby, most of the time.

  If you adopt Standard Ruby, what’s in it for you? Time saved that would’ve been
  spent arguing over how to set things up. Also, seamless upgrades: we stay on 
  top
  of each new RuboCop rule and update our configuration on a monthly release
  cadence. But the best part of adopting Standard as your linter and formatter?
  You’ll spend a whole lot less time thinking about linters and formatters.

  So please, give Standard Ruby a try. If you’re like these
  folks » #who-uses-standard-ruby, you’ll soon realize that the value of a linter
  is in using one at all and not in the particulars of how it’s configured.

  Usage

    Install

    Getting started is as easy as gem install standard or throwing it in your
    project’s Gemfile and running bundle install:

    gem "standard"
    Running Standard Ruby

    Once installed, you can run Standard from the command line via its built-in
    executable or as a Rake task.

    Standard Ruby’s binary is named standardrb to distinguish it from
    StandardJS » https://github.com/standard/standard:

    $ standardrb
    And the Rake task can be run if your Rakefile includes require
    "standard/rake".  This will load the standard task, allowing you to run:

    $ rake standard
    Either way, Standard will inspect any Ruby files found in the current 
    directory
    tree. If any errors are found, it’ll report them. If your code is
    standard-compliant, it will get out of your way by quietly exiting code 0.

    Fixing errors

    A majority of Standard’s rules can be safely fixed automatically.

    # CLI
    $ standardrb --fix
    
    # Rake
    $ rake standard:fix
    Because we’re confident Standard’s fixes won’t change the behavior of our code,
    we typically run with fix enabled all the time because it saves us from having
    to look at and think about problems the computer can solve for us.

    Applying unsafe fixes

    There are a number of other rules that can be automatically remedied, but 
    not
    without the risk of changing your code’s behavior. While we wouldn’t recommend
    running it all the time, if the CLI suggests that additional errors can be 
    fixed
    unsafely, here’s how to do that:

    # CLI
    $ standardrb --fix-unsafely
    
    # Rake
    $ rake standard:fix_unsafely
    So long as your code is checked into source control, there’s no mortal harm in
    running with unsafe fixes enabled. If the changes look good to you and your
    tests pass, then it’s probably no more error prone than manually editing
    every change by hand.

  Integrating Standard into your workflow

  Because code formatting is so integral to programming productivity and linter
  violations risk becoming bugs if released into production, tools like
  Standard Ruby are only as useful as their integration into code editors and
  continuous integration systems.

    Editor support

    We’ve added a number of editing guides for getting started:

    ● VS Code » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-vscode
    ● vim » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-vim
    ● neovim » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-neovim
    ● RubyMine » https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/rubocop.html#disable_rubocop
    ● emacs » https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#syntax-checker-ruby-standard
    ● Helix » https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/External-formatter-configuration#standardrb
    ● Atom » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-Atom

    If you’d like to help by creating a guide, please draft one in an
    issue » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/issues/new and we’ll get it
    added!

      Language Server Protocol support

      If you don’t see your preferred editor above, Standard Ruby also offers robust
      language server » https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/ support,
      in two ways, both included with the standard gem:

      1. A Ruby LSP » https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp add-on, which (if
      the standard gem is in your Gemfile) will be loaded automatically
      2. A language server executable, which can be run from the command line
      with standardrb --lsp

      Due to the advantages of Pull diagnostics and its inclusion of Code 
      Actions
      (“Quick Fixes” in VS Code parlance), we recommend using Standard’s Ruby LSP
      add-on » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/IDE:-vscode#using-ruby-lsp
      where possible.

      Regardless of which language server you use, many editors have added LSP
      support, with each bringing their own approach to configuration. Many LSP
      features should “just work”, but when in doubt, please consult our editor
      guides above » #editor-support as well as your editor’s own documentation on how
      to configure LSP formatters and linters.

    CI support

    Various continuous integration and quality-checking tools have been made to
    support Standard Ruby, as well.

    ● GitHub Actions » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-ruby-action
    ● Code Climate » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/wiki/CI:-Code-Climate
    ● Pronto » https://github.com/julianrubisch/pronto-standardrb
    ● Danger » https://github.com/ashfurrow/danger-rubocop/

    Of course, no special plugin is necessary to run Standard Ruby in a CI
    environment, as standardrb and rake standard work just fine on their own!

    Other tools

    These tool integrations are also available:

    ● Guard » https://github.com/JodyVanden/guard-standardrb
    ● Spring » https://github.com/lakim/spring-commands-standard

  Ignoring errors

  While Standard is very strict in how each formatting and linting rule is 
  configured,
  it’s mercifully flexible when you need to ignore a violation to focus on a higher
  priority (like, say, keeping the build running). There are a number of ways to
  ignore any errors, with the right answer depending on the situation.

    Ignoring a line with a comment

    Individual lines can be ignored with a comment directive at the end of the 
    line.
    As an example, the line text = 'hi' violates two rules,
    Lint/UselessAssignment » https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_lint.html#lintuselessassignment
    and
    Style/StringLiterals » https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_style.html#stylestringliterals.

    You could ignore one, both, or all errors with the following comments:

    # Disable one error but keep Lint/UselessAssignment
    text = 'hi' # standard:disable Style/StringLiterals
    
    # Disable both errors explicitly
    text = 'hi' # standard:disable Style/StringLiterals, Lint/UselessAssignment
    
    # Disable all errors on the line with "all"
    text = "hi" # standard:disable all
    Ignoring multiple lines with comments

    Similarly to individual lines, you can also disable multiple lines by 
    wrapping
    them in comments that disable and re-enable them:

    # standard:disable Style/StringLiterals, Lint/UselessAssignment
    text = "hi"
    puts 'bye'
    # standard:enable Style/StringLiterals, Lint/UselessAssignment
    Ignoring entire files and globs

    You can ignore entire files and file patterns by adding them to ignore: in
    your project’s .standard.yml file:

    ignore:
      - 'some/file/in/particular.rb'
      - 'a/whole/directory/**/*'
    Ignoring specific rules in files and globs

    For a given file or glob, you can even ignore only specific rules by 
    nesting an
    array of the rules you’d like to ignore:

    ignore:
      - 'test/**/*':
        - Layout/AlignHash
    Ignoring every violation and converting them into a todo list

    If you’re adopting Standard in a large codebase and you don’t want to convert
    everything all at once, you can work incrementally by generating a “todo” file
    which will cause Standard to ignore every violation present in each file of 
    the
    codebase.

    This way, you can gradually work through the todo list, removing ignore
    directives and fixing any associated errors, while also being alerted to any
    regressions if they’re introduced into the project.

    Here are the commands you might run to get started:

    # Start by clearing any auto-fixable errors:
    $ standardrb --fix
    
    # Generate a `.standard_todo.yml' to work from
    $ standardrb --generate-todo
  Configuring Standard

  While the rules aren’t configurable, Standard offers a number of options that
  can be configured as CLI flags and YAML properties.

    CLI flags

    The easiest way to summarize the available CLI flags is to invoke standardrb -h:

    Usage: standardrb [--fix] [--lsp] [-vh] [--format <name>] [--] [FILE]...
    
    Options:
    
      --fix             Apply automatic fixes that we're confident won't break 
    your code
      --fix-unsafely    Apply even more fixes, including some that may change 
    code behavior
      --no-fix          Do not automatically fix failures
      --format <name>   Format output with any RuboCop formatter (e.g. "json")
      --generate-todo   Create a .standard_todo.yml that lists all the files 
    that contain errors
      --lsp             Start a LSP server listening on STDIN
      -v, --version     Print the version of Standard
      -V, --verbose-version   Print the version of Standard and its 
    dependencies.
      -h, --help        Print this message
      FILE              Files to lint [default: ./]
    
    Standard also forwards most CLI arguments to RuboCop. To see them, run:
    
      $ rubocop --help
    If you run Standard via Rake, you can specify your CLI flags in an 
    environment
    variable named STANDARDOPTS like so:

    $ rake standard STANDARDOPTS="--format progress"
    YAML options

    In addition to CLI flags, Standard will search for a .standard.yml file
    (ascending to parent directories if the current working directory doesn’t
    contain one). If you find yourself repeatedly running Standard with the same
    CLI options, it probably makes more sense to set it once in a YAML file:

    fix: true               # default: false
    parallel: true          # default: false
    format: progress        # default: Standard::Formatter
    ruby_version: 3.0       # default: RUBY_VERSION
    default_ignores: false  # default: true
    
    ignore:                 # default: []
      - 'vendor/**/*'
    
    plugins:                # default: []
      - standard-rails
    
    extend_config:                # default: []
      - .standard_ext.yml
      Configuring ruby_version

      One notable YAML setting is ruby_version, which allows you to set the oldest
      version of Ruby the project needs to support RuboCop’s TargetRubyVersion
      setting » https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration.html#setting-the-target-ruby-version
      explicitly. Because this value is inferred from any .ruby-version,
      .tool-versions, Gemfile.lock, and *.gemspec files that might be present,
      most applications won’t need to set this.

      However, gems and libraries that support older versions of Ruby will want
      to lock the ruby-version: explicitly in their .standard.yml file to ensure
      new rules don’t break old rubies:

      ruby_version: 2.7
  Extending Standard

  Standard includes two extension mechanisms: plugins and configuration
  extensions. While neither can change the rules configured out-of-the-box by
  Standard, they can define, require, and configure additional RuboCop rules.

  Both are “first-in-wins”, meaning once a rule is configured by a plugin or
  extension, it can’t be changed or reconfigured by a later plugin or extension.
  This way, each Standard plugin you add becomes a de facto “standard” of its
  own. Plugins have precedence over extensions as they are loaded first.

    Plugins

    Adding a plugin to your project is as easy as adding it to your Gemfile and
    specifying it in .standard.yml in the root of your project. For example, after
    installing standard-rails » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-rails, you
    can configure it by adding it to plugins:

    plugins:
      - standard-rails
    Each plugin can be passed configuration options by specifying them in a 
    nested
    hash. For example, standard-rails allows you to configure its rules for
    a particular version of Rails (though this will usually be detected for you
    automatically):

    plugins:
      - standard-rails:
          target_rails_version: 7.0
    You can develop your own plugins, too! Check out the
    lint_roller » https://github.com/standardrb/lint_roller gem to learn how. For a
    simple example, you can look at
    standard-custom » https://github.com/standardrb/standard-custom, which is one
    of the default plugins included by Standard.

    Extended config files

    Of course, you may want to add more rules without going to the trouble
    of packaging them in a plugin gem. For cases like this, you can define one 
    or
    more RuboCop configuration
    files » https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration.html and then list them
    in your .standard.yml file under extend_config.

    For example, after installing the
    betterlint » https://github.com/Betterment/betterlint gem from our friends at
    Betterment » https://www.betterment.com, we could create a RuboCop config
    file named .betterlint.yml:

    require:
      - rubocop/cop/betterment.rb
    
    Betterment/UnscopedFind:
      Enabled: true
    
      unauthenticated_models:
        - SystemConfiguration
    And then reference it in our .standard.yml:

    extend_config:
      - .betterlint.yml
    Running Standard’s rules via RuboCop

    Please note that the following usage is not supported and may break at any
    time. Use at your own risk and please refrain from opening GitHub issues 
    with
    respect to loading Standard or its plugins’ YAML configurations for use by
    the rubocop CLI.

    If you find that neither plugins or configuration extensions meet your 
    needs or
    if you have some other reason to run Standard’s rules with RuboCop’s CLI (e.g.,
    to continue using your favorite IDE/tooling/workflow with RuboCop support) 
    Evil
    Martians also maintains a regularly updated
    guide » https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/rubocoping-with-legacy-bring-your-ruby-code-up-to-standard
    on how to configure RuboCop to load and execute Standard’s ruleset.

    In short, you can configure this in your .rubocop.yml to load Standard’s three
    default rulesets, just as you would any other gem:

    require:
      - standard
      - standard-custom
      - standard-performance
      - rubocop-performance
    
    inherit_gem:
      standard: config/base.yml
      standard-custom: config/base.yml
      standard-performance: config/base.yml

  Help, I’m seeing an install error!

  This section is really only here to feed Google, but if you see an error like
  any of the following:

  ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'standard' (= 0.0.36) in any repository
  Could not find gem 'standard (= 0.0.36)' in rubygems repository 
  https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally.
  Your bundle is locked to standard (0.0.36) from rubygems repository 
  https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally, but that version can no longer be 
  found in that source. That means the author of standard (0.0.36) has removed 
  it. You'll need to update your bundle to a version other than standard 
  (0.0.36) that hasn't been removed in order to install.
  This is because on August 18th, 2023, we yanked versions 0.0.1~0.0.36.1 from
  RubyGems.org » https://rubygems.org for the reasons discussed in this
  issue » https://github.com/standardrb/standard/issues/340. Because these
  versions are now over four years old and no longer track supported versions of
  Ruby or RuboCop, the correct fix for any of the above errors is probably to
  upgrade to the latest version of Standard Ruby.

  If for whatever reason you need to install one of these versions, you can
  change your Gemfile to point to the corresponding git tag from the source
  repository:

  gem "standard", git: "https://github.com/testdouble/standard.git", tag: 
  "v0.0.36"
